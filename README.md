This project was a class assignment in a popular Web Design course at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The assignment required students to build a small, responsive website to demonstrate foundational skills in HTML and CSS, covering key concepts such as:

Semantic HTML structure

CSS styling (flexbox, grid, or traditional layouts)

Responsive design principles

Basic interactivity (e.g., hover effects, simple animations)


I gained hands-on experience in:

Translating design mockups into functional web pages (Figma)

Debugging and optimizing CSS for different screen sizes
