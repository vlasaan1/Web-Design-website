This project was a class assignment in a Web Design course at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The assignment required students to build a small, responsive website to demonstrate foundational skills in HTML and CSS, covering key concepts such as:

    Semantic HTML structure

    CSS styling (flexbox, grid, or traditional layouts)

    Responsive design principles

    Basic interactivity (e.g., hover effects, simple animations)


I gained hands-on experience in:

    Translating design mockups into functional web pages (Figma)

    Debugging and optimizing CSS for different screen sizes

I have imported this project from a zip file - lost my commit history.
